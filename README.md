### This **WILL NOT** be getting compiled as I do not run Chrome anymore. If you want to compile the extension, simply follow the following:
1. Go [here](chrome://extensions) (it's "chrome://extensions")
2. Activate Developer Mode
3. Upload the Unpacked (or Pack it as a ZIP)
4. Feel free to create an issue with the compiled version.
